Signature Verification Using Image Processing in MATLAB
This project implements a signature verification system using image processing techniques in MATLAB. The system compares a provided signature against a reference signature to determine authenticity.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Converts images to grayscale, applies noise reduction, and enhances signature features.
Feature Extraction: Extracts key features like contours, edges, and geometric properties of the signature.
Signature Matching: Compares extracted features to determine similarity.
Visualization: Displays preprocessing and feature extraction steps for analysis.
Requirements
MATLAB R2020a or later.
Toolboxes:
Image Processing Toolbox.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd signature-verification-matlab
Open the project in MATLAB.
Usage
Place the reference and test signature images in the images folder.
Edit the file paths in the script:
matlab
Copy code
referenceImage = 'images/reference.png';
testImage = 'images/test.png';
Run the main script:
matlab
Copy code
run('signature_verification.m');
View the results in the MATLAB command window and plots.
Workflow
Load Images: Import the reference and test signature images.
Preprocess Images: Convert to grayscale, normalize, and remove noise.
Extract Features: Use image processing techniques to identify and compare signature characteristics.
Compare and Validate: Match features using similarity metrics.
Example
Input:

Reference signature: images/reference.png
Test signature: images/test.png
Output:

Match score: 85%
Result: Signature Matched
