# Signature Verification Project (MATLAB)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on signature verification using image processing techniques implemented in MATLAB. The goal is to verify the authenticity of a signature by analyzing its features and comparing it with a reference signature.

## Features
- Preprocessing of images (grayscale conversion, noise removal, thresholding).
- Feature extraction for identifying signature characteristics.
- Matching algorithm for comparing input and reference signatures.
- User-friendly interface for testing and results display.

## Technologies Used
- **MATLAB**: For implementing image processing algorithms and creating the verification system.

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB installed on your system (R2021b or later recommended).
- Basic knowledge of MATLAB and image processing.

Sample Output
Matched Signature: Displays similarity score and verification as "Signature Match."
Unmatched Signature: Displays similarity score and verification as "Signature Dosen't Match."

Future Improvements
Enhance feature extraction with advanced methods (e.g., SIFT, SURF).
Incorporate machine learning techniques for better accuracy.
Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use.
