Handwritten Digit Recognition Using MNIST Dataset
This project demonstrates the implementation of a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset. It employs machine learning techniques to classify and predict digits (0-9) based on input images.

Features
Dataset Utilization: Uses the MNIST dataset containing 70,000 labeled grayscale images of handwritten digits.
Model Training: Implements machine learning models, including neural networks, to achieve high accuracy.
Visualization: Displays sample images, loss curves, and accuracy metrics during training and evaluation.
Interactive Prediction: Allows users to input or draw custom images for prediction.
Requirements
Python 3.8 or later.
Libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
tensorflow or keras
scikit-learn
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
Installation

Usage
Load the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow or Keras.
Preprocess the data:
Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Reshape the input data for compatibility with the model.
Train the model:
Build a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
Train the model using the training dataset.
Evaluate the model:
Test the model on the validation dataset to assess accuracy.
Predict custom inputs:
Provide a custom digit image for prediction.
Example Workflow
Input: Handwritten digit image from the MNIST dataset.
Training: A neural network model with one hidden layer and softmax activation.
Output: Predicted digit with confidence score.
Results
Training Accuracy: ~98%
Test Accuracy: ~97%
